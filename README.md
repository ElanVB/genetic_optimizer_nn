# My Own Genetic Algorithm to Optimize Neural Networks
I know how genetic algorithms typically work, I know how neural networks work, so I decided to put my knowledge of the two together and see what happens.
This is definitely not the best or most developed idea or version (yet).
I am going to be working on this every now and again to add some cool new features that will allow us to get insight into the process and find better solutions.

To demo the model that is already trained just use the following command: `python demo_cart_pole_ai.py`.
